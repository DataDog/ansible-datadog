# This file doesn't actually contain "handlers" in the Ansible sense: when running
# our role, Ansible only loads the contents of handlers/main.yml as handlers.
# However, this is here because this is a "handler-like" task that is dynamically
# included by a handler task in handlers/main.yml.

# NOTE: We don't use bootout/bootstrap here, because bootout can't wait for the operation
# to finish and if it's in progress for a longer time, bootstrap fails. We use the old
# unload/load combo because they actually wait.
