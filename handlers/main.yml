# We can't add the Windows Agent service restart handler directly here because that makes the role require
# the ansible.windows collection on all platforms. We only want it to be needed on Windows.
# Therefore, what we do is the following: when needed, our Windows tasks call this handler to require a
# Windows Agent restart (through notify: restart datadog-agent-win).
# When notified, the below handler is executed at the end of the playbook run.
# The include_tasks loads the handlers/main-win.yml file, which contains the real service restart task
# (which depends on ansible.windows), and runs it, triggering the Windows Agent restart.
